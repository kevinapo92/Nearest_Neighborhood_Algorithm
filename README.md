# Nearest_Neighborhood_Algorithm

## Introduction 
This repository provides an implementation of the Nearest Neighbor "heuristic" algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The algorithm follows a simple procedure to find a solution to the TSP:

1. Start from a city and mark it as the current city.
2. Find the nearest unvisited city to the current city and update the current city with this neighbor.
3. Repeat Step 2 until each city is visited.
4. Apply the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for each city, trying different starting points for the tour.
5. Output the shortest tour and its corresponding distance.
6. Compare the result to the optimal solution for evaluation.

**Features**
* Solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem using the Nearest Neighbor "heuristic" algorithm.
* Find a suboptimal solution by iteratively selecting the nearest unvisited city.
* Output the shortest tour and its distance for each starting city.
* Compare the result to the optimal solution for performance evaluation.
